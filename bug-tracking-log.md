- Upload errors: Generic "Upload failed" messages
- Rate limit errors: Detailed technical information
- Validation errors: Minimal user guidance

**Impact**: 
- User confusion during error conditions
- Inconsistent help/recovery information
- Professional appearance compromised

**Resolution Plan**:
1. Create standardized error message templates
2. Implement user-friendly error translation
3. Add actionable recovery suggestions
4. Ensure consistent styling and presentation
