# StormwaterAI

## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered stormwater solution system that automatically generates professional documents based on uploaded problem scenarios. When users upload any problem document (e.g., "collapsing culvert"), the system analyzes the entire document library and auto-generates relevant solution documents including inspection forms, Job Safety Analyses (JSAs), maintenance plans, monitoring protocols, and compliance checklists - all with proper citations from the source library. The system transforms simple problem descriptions into complete actionable solution packages for professional stormwater management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite for build tooling
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives
