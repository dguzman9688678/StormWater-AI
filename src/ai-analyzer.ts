**CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Write in natural, flowing paragraphs - NOT bullet points or repetitive lists
2. Avoid repetitive content - each section must be unique and distinct
3. Use professional, readable language with technical precision
4. Create coherent narrative flow between sections
5. No duplicate information across sections
6. Write as a cohesive document, not fragmented pieces
7. Each paragraph should add new information without redundancy

Generate a polished, professional document with natural language flow.`;
